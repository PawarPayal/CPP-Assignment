# Customized Virtual File System:

-The purpose of this project is to use the C programming language to develop a simple Customised Virtual File System (CVFS). 
-CVFS serves as a "manager" for files and folders on a computer's hard drive.  
-I Provide All Implementations Of Necessary System Calls And Commands Of File subsystem As : Open, Close, Read, Write, Lseek, Create, RM, LS, Stat, Fstat etc.
-While Creating This Project All Above Functionality I Use Our Own Data Structures By Referring Algorithms of UNIX Operating System.
-By Using This Project I Can Get Overview Of UFS (UNIX File System) On Any Platform.
-In This Project I Emulate All Data Structures Which Are Used By Operating System To Manage File System Oriented Tasks.  
-As The Name Suggests Its Virtual Because I Maintain All The Records In Primary Storage (RAM).
